# Test APPs

Code examples to compare weather and satellite maps.

[Example 1] (https://godnik.github.io/apps/owm-gibs.html) - Openweathermap layers (Temperature, Rain, Pressure) combined with daily satellite from NASA's GIBS service.
Openweathermap layers are provided with custom styles which one can customize using CartoCSS synthax.


[Example 2] (https://godnik.github.io/apps/modis-compare.html) - The comparison of VANE (Openweathermap) and NASA GIBS as for Terra satellite layers in web-mercator projection. The VANE layer is updated faster. And there is some difference in color processing algorithms. Also there is some issue to use GIBS layer with a transparent background in order to overlay it on the top of base maps.
The sliderâ€™s bar enables to switch between two maps.
